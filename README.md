# GitHub Auditor
`gh-auditor` is program that allows you to easily check if your organisation
meets your criteria.

## Checks

* Organisation has 2 Factor Authenication enabled
* Seperate accounts for adminstration
* All master branches are protected

#### In Progress
- [ ] Member whitelist
- [ ] Admin whitelist
- [ ] Additional branch protection checks (e.g. requiring verified commits)

## Example Output
```
‚è≥ Auditing 2 Factor Authentication
‚ùóÔ∏è Warning:
2 Factor Authentication is not required for members of the organisation.

üí° Recommendation:
Enable 2 Factor as a requirement for members.

‚è≥ Auditing Admin Commit Activity
‚ùóÔ∏è Warning:
Admins (XAMPPRocky) have push activity. This is usually an indication that admin
members are using their accounts for purposes other than administration.

üí° Recommendation:
Create seperate accounts for administration access to the organisation.

‚è≥ Auditing Protected master branches.
‚ùóÔ∏è Warning:
Repositories (gh-audit-test/test-repo) have unprotected master branches. This
could lead to accidental data loss.

üí° Recommendation:
Protect master branches and require all commits are made through PRs.
```

## Install
```
cargo install gh-auditor
```

## Usage
To run an audit on an organisation you need provide the organisation name and
a GitHub access token with `admin:read` rights.

```
gh-auditor rust-lang
```

By default `gh-auditor` will try to read from the `GITHUB_API_KEY` environment
variable. You can supply it from the command line.

```
gh-auditor -t "<token>" rust-lang
```
